# o2
O2 is a new communication protocol and implementation
for music systems that aims to replace Open Sound Control
(OSC). Many computer musicians routinely deal with
problems of interconnection in local area networks, unreliable
message delivery, and clock synchronization. O2
solves these problems, offering *named services*, automatic
network *address discovery*, *clock synchronization*, and
a *reliable message delivery option*, as well as *interoperability*
with existing OSC libraries and applications.
Aside from these new features, O2 owes much of its design
to OSC and is mostly compatible with and similar to
OSC. O2 addresses the problems of inter-process communication
with a minimum of complexity.
