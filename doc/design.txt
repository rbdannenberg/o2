Performance
-----------
On Roger's MacBook Pro, optimized client/server takes 64 microseconds
for round trip, or 32 microseconds for a send through localhost.

2nd try: liblo 33us per send

with -O3 optimization, liblo is 23us per message

with -O3 and non-blocking receive, liblo is 17.5us


O2 takes 40s for 1M messages round trip -> 40us per round trip or 20us
for a send through localhost

With non-blocking poll(), O2 takes 14us per message

With poll() and 1ms timeout, O2 takes 24us per message in debug version
 
With blocking_hack which set timeout to -1, O2 takes 21us per message  

June 8: 1M messages in 48.95s -> 49us/round-trip on 3GHz Core i7
but on my 2.4GHz Core i7 OS X 10.7.5, round-trip was 29us, so that's
15us per message.  

Message Handling
----------------
For non-pattern messages, just use a hash table for whole pattern including
service name.

For pattern messages, use a tree and match each node. Each node in the tree
is a dictionary of keys to either handler or another node.

The dictionary should be a hash table with linked overflow to simplify
deletions. The dictionary should have between 2 and 3 times as many locations
as data items.

Discovery Protocol
------------------
New processes broadcast to 5 ports in sequence, initially every 0.33s
but increase the interval by 10% each time until a maximum interval of
4s is reached. This gives a message every 40ms on average when there
are 100 processes. Also gives 2 tries on 5 ports within first 2s.

In addition to sending broadcast messages, we send messages to
localhost because broadcast messages (at least on OS X) are not
received on the same machine. The locolhost messages are sent at the
same times as the broadcast messages and to the same ports, except
that there is no need to send localhost messages to a process's own
discovery port.

When a discovery message arrives, we check:
1) if the application name does not match, ignore the message
2) if the IP:PORT string is already in the master_table (as a process)  
   do no further processing
3) if the IP:PORT string (process name) in the message is lower than
   the receiver's name, do not process the message, but send a
   discovery message back to the sender.
4) Otherwise, create a process descriptor in master_table and initiate
   a connection to the process.

Connection is made via TCP. Since we want to share the clock
synchronization states, the connecting process must send clock state
as well as its name (because it cannot know if any previous discovery
message was sent or received) and UDP port. The connected-to process
must have gotten a discovery message to the connecting process
(otherwise the connection would not take place), but we do not know
when the message was sent and the clock synchronization state might
have changed in the interim, so there's no use sending clock state
with discovery messages. Instead, the connected-to process will send a
status message to the connecting process.

Summary: discovery messages need only send IP and TCP server
ports. Processes are named by strings of the form "128.2.1.50:54321"
and the higher name (using strcmp()) connects to the lower name. After
the TCP connection is established, *both* processes send their
endianness (as "l" or "b"), IP, TCP port, UDP port, and clock
synchronization state.

Connection Walkthrough
----------------------

Processes are connected two ways: connect and accept.

For the connect case, the sequence starts with the receipt of a
discovery message, handled by:
  - o2_discovery_handler: A process entry is created by
    - add_remote_process with state PROCESS_CONNECTING. The tcp
      socket is then created using
    - make_tcp_connection which makes a socket with
      - make_tcp_recv_socket and is connected to the remote process.
    After connection, the status becomes PROCESS_CONNECTED.
    We send the !_o2/in initialization message using 
    - o2_send_by_tcp. 
    We then send services to the remote process.  
    When we made the socket, the handler was set to
  - tcp_initial_handler, which calls
    - o2_discovery_init_handler. This function updates the process
      entry with tcp_port (TODO: not needed?), the udp_port,
      the process status (either PROCESS_OK or PROCESS_NO_CLOCK,
      depending on the clock sync information from the incoming
      message), and the udp_sa socket address which is used to
      send UDP messages.
      

For the accept case, we just add the newly accepted socket and set the
handler to
  - tcp_initial_handler. At this point, there is no process entry.
    The tcp_initial_handler ensures the incoming !_o2/in message is
    complete and passes it off to
    - o2_discovery_init_handler. This function does a lookup on the
      process entry and discovers it is not there, so it makes
      one with
      - add_remote_process. The process entry is intialized and the
        status becomes either PROCESS_OK or PROCESS_NO_CLOCK.
      We send the !_o2/in initialization message using 
      - o2_send_by_tcp. 
    We then send services to the remote process.  


Services
--------
After making a connection, the connecting process sends all local
services. If a new service is added, all connected processes are sent
information about the new service. Similarly if a service is removed,
all connected processes are sent a "remove service" message.

Process State Protocol
----------------------
Internally, remote process descriptors go through a sequence of
states:
* PROCESS_DISCOVERED - a discovery message has revealed this process.
* PROCESS_CONNECTING - a connection request has been issued.
* PROCESS_CONNECTED - the connection has been completed, waiting for
                      the initial status message.
* PROCESS_NO_CLOCK - the process status message has arrived, and the
                     process does not yet have clock sync. 
* PROCESS_OK - the process status message has arrived and the process
               has clock sync.

The local process (o2_process) is initialized with the state
PROCESS_NO_CLOCK and when it either becomes the master or clock
synchronization is achieved the state changes to PROCESS_OK.

Initially, processes have no clock and no services. Status information
is obtained on a per-service basis using
    o2_status("service-name")
which initially will return O2_FAIL.

Periodically, the clock_sync "thread" (which is just a scheduled
handler that reschedules itself periodically to do clock sync
activities) checks the status of the "_cs" service.  When it exists
locally, clock sync is achieve implicitly. When it exists remotely,
clock synchronization starts, and after some time, it will be
established.

For local services, the status values are:
* O2_LOCAL_NOTIME - the service is local, but we cannot send scheduled  
    messages because we do not have a synchronized clock  
* O2_LOCAL - the service is local, and timed messages will work  
 
For remote services, the status values are:
* O2_REMOTE_NOTIME - the service is remote, but we cannot send scheduled 
    messages because we do not have a synchronized clock 
* O2_REMOTE - the service is remote, and timed messages will work 

To implement the remote status, we need to know if the *remote*
process has clock synchronization. Therefore, when clock
synchronization is achieved, a process will send a message to all
connected processes "register" the fact that they are
synchronized. When connecting to a new process, the discovery info
will include clock synchronization status.

Messages
--------

!_o2/dy "sssii" b_or_l_endian application_name ip tcp_port udp_port
        o2_discovery_handler(): message arrives by UDP broadcast or a
        send to localhost; this is a notification that another O2
        process exists. The tcp_port is the server port listening for
        connections. The udp_port is the discovery port.

!_o2/in "ssiii" b_or_l_endian ip tcp_port_number udp_port_number clocksync
        o2_initial_handler(): message arrives via tcp to initialize
        connection between two processes. clocksync is true (1) if the
        process is already synchronized to the master clock

!_o2/sv "s..." process_name service1 service2 ...
        o2_services_handler(): message arrives via tcp to announce the
        initial list or an additional service

!_o2/sd "ss" process_name service
        o2_service_delete_handler(): message arrives via tcp to
        announce the service has been deleted from the sending process

!_o2/ds ""
        o2_discovery_send_handler(): (no arguments) send next
        discovery message via broadcast and send to localhost

!_o2/ps ""
        o2_ping_send_handler(): (no arguments) send next ping message
        to clock service (_cs)

!_cs/get "is" serial_no reply_to
        o2_ping_handler(): sends serial_no and master clock time back
        to sender by appending "/get-reply" to the reply_to argument
        to form a reply path.

<path>/get-reply "it" serial_no master_time
        o2_ping_reply_handler(): receive the time read from the master
        clock (via udp) in response to a !_cs/get message.


Extensions
----------

o2_tap(const char *tappee, const char *tapper) -- request a copy of 
    each message delivered to tappee (a service). The message is
    retransmitted to tapper (another service) by replacing the
    service name in the address and sending the message. The
    implementation works by adding info about the tapper into the
    array of services (services_entry) for tappee (in every process).
    The services_entry list is sorted as follows:
    The actual service provider is first. The next entries are
    tappers. After the tappers follow all the non-active service
    providers.

    When a message is received for the service and the actual provider
    is remote, just send the message to the actual provider. If the
    actual provider is local, resend the message to each tapper (if
    any). The messages are sent reliably.

    The tapper will see all messages actually delivered to the service
    in the order in which they are delivered, and with the original
    timestamps, but of course, the tapper will receive the messages 
    later than the tappee. One exception is when a service is
    delegated to an OSC server. In that case, bundles (because they
    have timestamps) are forwarded immediately to the OSC server and
    the actual delivery order of the bundle is unknown to
    O2. If there is a tapper, the OSC bundle is converted back to an
    O2 bundle addressed to the tapper, and the bundle is sent
    immediately; this may cause the bundle and/or components to arrive
    early, be scheduled, and be delivered to the tapper in a different
    order than that seen by the OSC server. On the other hand, bundles
    delivered to O2 services are decomposed into individual messages
    and forwarded to the tapper individually.
    
    When a service disappears, it should no longer be a
    tapper, so (for now), we will search all service entries for
    them. When a tappee disappears, there may be another service
    offering that replaces it. This would have to be in a different
    process. When the service changes over to this new process,
    messages to it will be forwarded to the tapper. There are race
    conditions; for example the tapper cannot distinguish old tappee
    messages from new tappee messages except by noticing that the old
    tappee has been deleted, but deleting the old tappee is not a
    system-wide atomic operation, so the old tappee status could be
    unchanged at the tapper process even while the tapper is receiving
    messages from the new tappee.

    An alternative design: o2_subscribe(service)
    announces service to all. Unlike normal services, where the
    message is sent to the "highest ranked" service when there are
    duplicates, subscribers are kept as a separate list so to deliver
    to a service, you send to the highest ranked "normal" service AND
    you send the same message to each subscriber. A problem with this
    approach is that messages could arrive to each subscriber in a
    different order. By using o2_tap() and resending messages, all
    messages will be received in the same order at the tapper as in
    the original tappee.

    Another design question was whether to send future timestamped
    messages to the tapper immediately, allowing the tapper to receive
    messages at exactly the same logical time as the tappee in the
    forward synchronous cases. This would create a situation where a
    mix of immediate and future timestamps could be received in a
    different order at the tapper. Since the main use of the tapper
    mechanism is debugging and monitoring, it seems more valuable to
    have a record of messages in their correct order (and also in the
    case of UDP, to know which messages are actually delivered.)

    This leaves the use case of "multiple subscribers" unaddressed. We
    have "many-to-one" messaging by allowing anyone to send to a
    service, but we do not have "one-to-many" messaging where multiple
    subscribers can receive from a "publisher." We propose handling
    this in the application: A "publisher" is just a service. Any
    subscriber process can send a service name to the publisher using
    a message of the form /publisher/subscribe "subscriber". The
    publisher keeps a list of subscribers (service names) and sends
    ("publishes") messages by sending to each of the subscribers. The
    publisher can also monitor the status of subscribers. When the
    subscriber (a service name) no longer exists, the publisher can
    drop the subscriber from its list.

!_o2/si "sis" service_name new_status ip_port
    This message is internally generated for the benefit of the
    application. It provides "service information" (hence the "si"
    address) when a service is discovered, destroyed, or its state
    changes. The ip_port string gives the current service provider. (A
    message is generated also if this changes. In that case, you would
    also get an !_o2/si message about the old provider process being
    destroyed since processes are services too, named by their ip:port
    string.)

!ip:port/cs/rt "s" reply_to
    Request the mean and min round-trip time from the clock
    synchronization protocol being run by the process named by
    ip:port. The reply is sent to the address formed by appending
    /get-reply to the reply_to argument. The reply message has type
    string "sff" and contains the ip_port of the receiver, the mean 
    and min from o2_roundtrip().

Web Monitor
-----------

Some notes on creating a web-based monitor. The monitor should connect
to a server that runs O2. The server is normally a local process, so
the "website" will be "localhost:12345" or some such port.

The web page should display a table of 
    process name (ip:port)
    service name
    checkbox for tapping messages to this service
    service status
    clock sync statistics (only displayed where service name is the
        process name
    
Also display a list of messages received from the tappees. Messages
should be displayed as timestamp, original address (reconstructed from
the actual address), typestring, and data values.
