about o2host

o2host is a generic O2 application that serves as a host to
applications that implement the o2lite protocol. o2lite
implements a subset of O2 and gains access to an O2 network
by connecting to a host, which is basically any process running
O2.  o2host is one such process that can be configured to
relay messages or convert o2lite to OSC or MIDI. o2host can
also relay OSC or MIDI or messages from a remote O2 process to
an o2lite process on the local network or same computer (i.e.
localhost).

Installation

On windows, you need pdcurses. I installed it using vcpkg. I'm
not sure how to use vcpkg, and my installation ended up in
my home directory. So I have 
C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/lib/pdcurses.lib
C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/include/curses.h
C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/bin/pdcurses.dll
among others.

Wherever your pdcurses package ends up, you will need to point cmake
to the directory o2/o2host and set CURSES_BASE to the location, e.g.
C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows
in my installation.

In addition, when you get o2host to compile, you will need to make
pdcurses.dll accessible. One way to do this is copy it to a directory
that is already on your DLL search path, e.g. I copied it to
C:\WINDOWS\system32
