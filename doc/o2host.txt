about o2host
============

o2host is a generic O2 application that serves as a host to
applications that implement the o2lite protocol. o2lite
implements a subset of O2 and gains access to an O2 network
by connecting to a host, which is basically any process running
O2.  o2host is one such process that can be configured to
relay messages or convert o2lite to OSC or MIDI. o2host can
also relay OSC or MIDI or messages from a remote O2 process to
an o2lite process on the local network or same computer (i.e.
localhost).

Compiling o2host
----------------

On windows:
- you need pdcurses. I installed it using vcpkg. I'm
    not sure how to use vcpkg, and my installation ended up in
    my home directory. So I have 
    C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/lib/pdcurses.lib
    C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/include/curses.h
    C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/bin/pdcurses.dll
    among others.
- In addition, when you get o2host to compile, you will need to make
    pdcurses.dll accessible. One way to do this is copy it to a directory
    that is already on your DLL search path, e.g. I copied it to
    C:\WINDOWS\system32

For all platforms:
- install PortMidi from github portmidi/portmidi.
- copy o2host/libraries-example.txt to o2host/libraries.txt and edit 
    libaries.txt to contain paths to PortMidi. 
- note that for Windows, your o2host/libraries.txt will set CURSES_BASE
    to the location where you installed pdcurses, e.g. it is
      C:/Users/Roger/research/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows
    in my installation.
- use CMake in o2/o2host to generate a Makefile linux or project for 
    Xcode (MacOS) or Visual Studio (Windows).
- build o2host with make (Linux) or your IDE (MacOs or Windows).


Running o2host
--------------
o2host must be run in a terminal or Command Prompt. It is NOT a GUI
application (although there is an option to make an app for MacOS that
runs o2host in a Terminal).

For general documentation, run o2host, use the tab key to navigate
to the help field and type X.

MIDI messages are converted to O2 messages which are sent to
/<service>/midi with type string "i" (int32) and with the
status byte in the low-order byte, the first data byte in
the next byte (i.e. shifted left 8 bits) and the second
data byte (if any) in the next byte (shifted left 16 bits).

O2 messages targeted to MIDI can use either type "i" or "m"
and are sent to /<service>/midi.

OSC messages are appended to the service name, e.g. to send
an OSC message to address /xyz/abc, send an O2 message to
/<service>/xyz/abc, and configure O2 host to forward
<service> messages to OSC.
