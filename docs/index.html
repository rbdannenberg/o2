<h2>Build and Installation</h2>
O2 uses CMake. For Windows and Mac, use CMake to build a solution or
project for Visual Studio or Xcode, then build the ALL_BUILD project.

<p>For Linux, use "ccmake ." to create a Makefile, then run make.

<p>Currently, there is no installer -- you should explicitly link to
libo2_static.a. Note that we only build a static library using the
current CMakeLists.txt configuration file.

<p>O2 is not compatible with recent changes in C compilers enabled by
the _FORTIFY_SOURCE macro. Therefore, we pass the command line flag
-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE to the compiler, and you may see some associated
warnings. (We're currently investigating how to best to get otherwise correct
code to compile without disabling the FORTIFY option or generate warnings.)

<h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
If O2 is not making connections or discovering services:
<ul>
<li>
Make sure you have a network connection. See if you can browse to some
Internet site on each machine that is not connecting via O2.
<li>
Check for firewalls. If you have a firewall, it must allow O2's
discovery ports and other ports that O2 creates, so you pretty much
have to enable all ports, at least while you are using O2. Try turning
off your firewall completely, at least to see if that fixes your
problems.
<li>
If you have a VPN connection, then O2 discovery messages will be
tunneled to some remote network. That might be what you want, but if
you are trying to connect to a local machine via O2 while you are
VPN'ed to some remote site (perhaps to read email securely?), then
close the VPN connection and try again.
