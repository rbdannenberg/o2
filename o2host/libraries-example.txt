# You MUST have libraries.txt to compile o2host
# This file is an EXAMPLE that you MUST copy to libraries.txt and 
# EDIT THIS FILE to contain correct paths to libraries

# o2host only depends on O2, which is in the parent directory
# and PortMidi. So we only need paths for PortMidi

# Where to find portmidi. Paths can be relative to this directory
# using CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, or absolute.
set(PM_INCL "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../portmidi/pm_common" CACHE PATH
            "Main PortMidi include directory")

    CACHE FILEPATH "PortMidi library - optimized version") 
set(PM_DBG_LIB
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../portmidi/Debug/libportmidi_static.a"
    CACHE FILEPATH "PortMidi library - debug version")

# Where to find curses library (Window only):
# This can be omitted when building for MacOS or Linux:
