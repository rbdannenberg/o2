# `o2litepy` - Python3 implementation of O2lite
### Roger B. Dannenberg and Zekai Shen

## Introducion
**O2** is a communication system for music, artists, and many other applications. It extends Open Sound Control with internet-wide discovery and communication, clock synchronization, named-services, and many other features. 

**O2lite** is a simplified protocol supported by O2 that allows a client to connect to O2 through an "O2 host," which could be any process running the full O2 protocol. The advantage of O2lite is that it is small and simple, able to run more easily in a native-Python implementation, on a microcontroller in C++, or even in MicroPython on a microcontroller.

- See [o2 on gitub](https://github.com/rbdannenberg/o2) for more information about O2.

- Note that there is a cross-platform `o2host` application that can serve as a bridget from o2lite to OSC, MIDI, and O2.
