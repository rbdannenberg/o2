\section Introduction

This documentation is divided into modules. Each module describes a
different area of functionality: Basics, Return Codes, Low-Level
Message Send, and Low-Level Message Parsing.

 \section Notes on Building the O2 Library

 O2 uses CMake, which can create a Linux Makefile, Xcode project, or
 Visual Studio solution. The basic procedure is run CMake (ccmake on
 Linux) to create the Makefile of project file, then build using make
 or your IDE. The main options for CMake are BUILD_MIDI_EXAMPLE:
 builds an example that depends on PortMidi (disable this option
 unless you need it), BUILD_STATIC_LIB: builds a static O2 library
 (recommended), BUILD_TESTS: builds a suite of tests (useful for
 O2 developers), and BUILD_TESTS_WITH_LIBLO: includes some tests
 that depends on the OSC library liblo (also useful for O2
 developers).

 To use O2 in your application, normally you should only need
 to include the O2 static library `o2_static.lib` into your project,
 make sure the path to o2.h is on your headers search path,
 and maybe put the path to `o2_static.lib` on your libraries
 search path.

 O2 depends on some libraries. On Windows, if your application
 includes O2, you will need to link to `winmm.lib` and
 `ws2_32.lib`. On OS X, you will need to link to the `CoreAudio`
 framework. On Linux, you will need to link to `asound` (you may
 have to install a developer package to get this), `pthread`, and
 `m` (the math library).

\section Overview

O2 is a communication protocol for interactive music and media
applications. O2 is inspired by Open Sound Control (OSC) and uses
similar means to form addresses, specify types, and encode messages.

However, in addition to providing message delivery, O2 offers a
discovery mechanism where processes automatically discover and connect
to other processes. Each process can offer zero or more named
"services," which are top-level nodes in a global, tree-structured
address space for a distributed O2 application. In O2, services
replace the notion of network addresses (e.g. 128.2.100.57) in OSC.

O2 is based on IP (Internet Protocol), but there are some mechanisms
that allow an O2 process to serve as a bridge to other networks such
as Bluetooth.

O2 addresses begin with the service name. Thus, a complete O2 address
would be written simply as "/synth/filter/cutoff," where "synth" is
the service name.

Furthermore, O2 implements a clock synchronization protocol. A single
process is designated as the "reference," and other processes
automatically synchronize their local clocks to the reference. All O2
messages are timestamped. Messages are delivered immediately, but
their designated operations are invoked according to the timestamp. A
timestamp of zero (0.0) means deliver the message
immediately. Messages with non-zero timestamps are only deliverable
after both the sender and receiver have synchronized clocks.

A service is created using the functions: 

    o2_service_new("service_name")

and

    o2_method_new("address," "types," handler, user_data, coerce, parse),

where o2_method_new is called to install a handler for each node, and each
"address" includes the service name as the first node.

Some major components and concepts of O2 are the following:

- **Ensemble** - a collection of collaborating processes are called
  an "ensemble." Ensembles are named by a simple ASCII string.
  In O2, all components belong to an ensemble, and O2 supports
  communication only *within* an ensemble. This allows multiple
  independent ensembles to co-exist and share the same local area
  network.

- **Host** - (conventional definition) a host is a computer (virtual
  or real) that may host multiple processes. Essentially, a Host is
  equivalent to an IP address.

- **Process** - (conventional definition) an address space and one or
  more threads. O2 assumes that all processing is performed by a single
  thread (O2 is not reentrant). A process can offer one or more O2 
  services and can serve as a client of O2 services in the same or other 
  processes. Each process using O2 has one directory of services shared
  by all O2 activity in that process (thus, this O2 implementation can 
  be thought of as a "singleton" object). The single O2 instance in a
  process belongs to one and only one ensemble. O2 does not support
  communication between ensembles. It is the responsibility of an O2 
  process to call #o2_poll frequently, giving O2 the opportunity to 
  receive and process messages as well as run background activities for
  discovery and clock synchronization. #o2_poll is non-blocking.

- **Service** - an O2 service is a named server that receives and acts
  upon O2 messages. A service is addressed by name. Multiple services
  can exist within one process. A service does not imply a (new) thread
  and all O2 messages are delivered sequentially from the single thread
  that calls #o2_poll. Service names begin with a letter with the
  exception of "_o2" which denotes the local process, "_cs", which denotes
  the reference clock, and `ip:port` strings, beginning with a digit, that
  denote a remote process.

- **Message** - an O2 message, similar to an OSC message, contains an 
  address pattern representing a function, a type string and a set of 
  values representing parameters. Messages are delivered to and handled
  be *services*. If there are multiple services with the same name, the
  service with the highest IP address and port number (lexicographically)
  gets the message. However, the *tap* mechanism can be used to achieve
  fan out from a single service (the *tappee*) to multiple services 
  (*tappers*).

- **Address Pattern** - O2 messages use URL-like addresses, as does OSC,
  but the top-level node in the hierarchical address space is the
  service name. Thus, to send a message to the "note" node of the
  "synth" service, the address pattern might be "/synth/note." The
  OSC pattern specification language is used unless the first character
  is "!", e.g. "!synth/note" denotes the same address as "/synth/note"
  except that O2 can assume that there are no pattern characters such
  as "*" or "[". The first part of an address is the service name; pattern
  characters are not allowed in the service name, so the service name
  must match exactly. A message may be delivered to the service itself,
  e.g. with address pattern "/synth". To receive such a message, the 
  service must have a single handler that handles every message to the
  service (see #o2_method_new).

- **Scheduler** - O2 implements two schedulers for timed message
  delivery. Schedulers are served by the same #o2_poll call that
  runs other O2 activity. The #o2_gtsched schedules according to the
  ensemble's reference clock time, but since this depends on clock
  synchronization, nothing can be scheduled until clock
  synchronization is achieved (typically within a few seconds of
  starting the process that provides the reference clock). For
  local-only services, it is possible to use the #o2_ltsched
  scheduler (not with #o2_send, but by explicitly constructing
  messages and scheduling them with #o2_schedule_msg. In any case,
  scheduling is useful *within* a service for any kind of timed
  activity.

\section Standard Messages

O2 uses O2 messages for some internal functions and also to communicate
status information with O2 processes. Since messages are dropped if there
is no handler, O2 processes need not set up handlers for all information.

In the following descriptions, if the *service name* is `ip:port` it means
the IP address and port number are used to construct a string, e.g. 
"192.200.145.8:40521" might be the actual service name.


\subsection Internal Messages

`/_o2/dy "ssii"` *ensemble_name* *local_ip* *tcp_port* *dy* -
this message is normally sent to the discovery port, but it can also be sent
as a result of calling #o2_hub and providing an O2 process address.
Processes must exchange discovery messages to be connected. The *dy* 
parameter is O2_DY_INFO, O2_DY_HUB, O2_DY_REPLY, O2_DY_CALLBACK, 
O2_DY_CONNECT, or O2_DY_O2LITE, depending on the expected response.

`/_o2/hub ""` - requests the receiver to become the hub for the sender

`/_o2/cs/cs ""` - announces when clock sync is obtained.

`/_o2/ds ""` - this message invokes the sending of discovery messages. It
is used with a timestamp to schedule periodic discovery message sending.

`/_cs/get "is" *serial-no* *reply-to* - send the time. The *reply-to*
parameter is the full address for the reply. The reply contains the type
string "it" and the parameters are the *serial-no* and the current time.

`/_o2/sv "ssbbs..."` *process-name* *service-name* *add-flag*
*service-flag* *tapper-or-properties* ... - reports service creation 
or deletion. Each service is described by name, true, and either true
followed by a properties string or false followed by the tapper 
name. If a service is deleted, then false is sent rather than true,
and if this is not a tap, the properties string is empty. The "..." 
notation here indicates that there can be any number of services 
described in this message, each service consisting of another "sbbs"
(string, Boolean, Boolean, string) sequence. Properties strings are
sent with escaped values, a leading ';' and a trailing ';'. This is
the first message sent when a process-to-process connection is made.


\subsection API Messages

`/_o2/cs/rt "s"` *reply-to* - A process can send this message to
request round trip (to the clock reference) information; *reply-to*
is the full address of the reply. The reply message has the type
string "sff" and the parameters are the process name (ip:port),
the mean round-trip time, and the minimum round-trip time.

`/_o2/ps ""` - this message invokes the sending of the `/_cs/get` message
to request the time as part of the clock synchronization protocol.

`/_o2/si "siss"` *service_name* *status* *process-name* *properties* -
Whenever an active service status changes, this message is sent to the
local process. Note that when a local service is created, an 
*internal* `/sv` message is sent to all other processes, and when that
process's services table is updated, if the service is or becomes
active, the change is reported locally to the application by sending
this `/_o2/si` message. Normally, you should not add handlers or use
the `_o2` service, but in this case, an application is expected to 
add a custom handler to receive status updates. 
    See #o2_status for a list of status values. In addition, 
O2_FAIL is reported when the current provider of a service is removed.
This may be followed immediately by another message to `/_o2/si` if
another provider offers the service.
    The service `_o2` is created before you can install a handler for 
`/_o2/si`, so you will not receive an `si` messages when `_o2` is created.
     If the service name begins with a digit, it represents a remote 
process and the name has the form IP:PORT, e.g. `128.237.161.165:50404`.
There is also an `IP:PORT` service representing the local process, but 
the local process is also represented by `_o2`, so the local `IP:PORT` 
service is never reported in an `/_o2/si` message. Instead, the string 
`"_o2"` indicates that *process* is the local one. You can get the local 
`IP:PORT` string by calling #o2_get_address or #o2_get_ip_port_string.
    The *properties* string contains the service properties in the form 
"attr1:value1;attr2:value2;" with no leading ";". If there are no 
properties, the string is empty. Values are escaped: within a value, the
characters ":;\" are preceded by "\" since ":" and ";" are separator
characters. Attribute names are alphanumeric.

 * #tappee is local and #tapper exists, the message is copied, 
 * modified by replacing the service name with #tapper, and sent.
 * There may be multiple taps on a single service, resulting in 
 * the delivery of multiple copies.
 * 
 * Taps can be used to implement a publish/subscribe
 * model. The publisher creates a local service and need not install
 * any message handlers. Subscribers install taps on the service to
 * receive messages. It is more efficient for the tappee to be in the
 * publisher process, but actually any process can publish to the
 * service with the added cost of sending a message to the tappee's
 * process.
 *
 * Messages with timestamps are held according to their timestamps.
 * Tappers receive the messages *after* the actual message dispatch.
 * Therefore, publish/subscribe using taps cannot achieve precise
 * timing with timestamps. (The recommended approach to timed 
 * publish/subscribe is to use properties: A service subscribing to
 * X sets a property such as "X-subscribe:yes". Publishers for X
 * periodically search for services with the ";X-subscribe:" attribute
 * with value "yes" and (re)build a subscriber list. To publish, the 
 * publisher explicitly sends a timed message to each subscriber.)
 *
 * Bundles are first unbundled before delivery, so tappers will not
 * receive bundles. Note that bundled messages each contain a timestamp
 * and service name which might differ from those of the bundle, so 
 * tapping is only applied individually to each bundled message when it
 * is actually delivered.
 *
 * While services are normally independent of processes (for example,
 * a new service can override an existing one in another process), 
 * tappers are tied to processes and cannot be overridden by 
 * another service of the same name. It is not redirected to 
 * another service provider. Also, unlike ordinary message delivery
 * that delivers one message even if there are multiple processes 
 * offering the service, there can be multiple tappers, even with the
 * same service names, and each tapper receives a copy of every message
 * delivered to the tappee.
 *
 * The lifetime of a tap is independent of the lifetimes of the tappee
 * and the tapper, but the tap is tied to a process, so if the process
 * is terminated, the tap is destroyed throughout the O2 ensemble. For
 * example, if the tappee's process crashes and restarts, and if the
 * tapper belongs to another process that survives, then the tap will
 * be reinstated on the tappee. Similarly, a tap may be created *before*
 * the tappee or the tapper. Calling #o2_service_free on a tapper will
 * *not* free the tap, so tap messages will continue to be delivered to
 * the tap's process, and if the tappper service is (re)created, these
 * tap messages will be delivered to the new tapper service.

 *  @return service status code.
 *
 * Note that codes are carefully ordered to allow testing for categories:
 * - to test if delivery is possible with a zero (immediate) timestamp,
 * use `o2_status(service) > O2_FAIL`, `o2_status(service) >= 0`, or
 * `o2_status(service) >= O2_LOCAL_NOTIME`.
 * - to test if delivery is possible with a non-zero timestamp, use
 * `o2_status(service) >= O2_LOCAL`. Note that status can change over
 * time, e.g. the status of a remote service will be #O2_FAIL until
 * the service is discovered. It will then change to #O2_REMOTE_NOTIME
 * until both the sender and receiver achieve clock synchronization
 * and share their synchronized status, and finally the status will
 * become #O2_REMOTE.
 *
 * In the cases with no clock sync, it is safe to send an immediate message
 * with timestamp = 0, but non-zero timestamps are meaningless because
 * either the sending process has no way to obtain a valid timestamp
 * or the receiver has no way to schedule delivery according to a
 * timestamp.
 *
 * Messages to services are *dropped* if the service has not been
 * discovered. Timestamped messages (timestamp != 0) are *dropped* if
 * the sender and receiver are not
 * clock-synchronized. (`o2_status(service) >= O2_LOCAL`).
 *
 * A special case is with `BRIDGE` and `OSC` services. In these cases,
 * the O2 process offering the service can either schedule the
 * messages locally, sending them according to the timestamp (and
 * suffering some network latency), or if the destination process is
 * synchronized, messages can be forwarded immediately for more
 * precise scheduling at their final destination. O2 does not provide
 * any way for clients/users to determine which of these methods is in
 * effect, and in the case of messages being forwarded by an
 * intermediary O2 process, the originator of the message cannot
 * determine whether the service is offered by an O2 server on the
 * local network, by an OSC server, or through a bridge to another
 * network such as Bluetooth. The status at the originator will be
 * simply #O2_REMOTE or #O2_REMOTE_NOTIME.
 *
 * When the status of a service changes, a message is sent with address
 * `!_o2/si`. The type string is "sis" and the parameters are (1) the 
 * service name, (2) the new status, and (3) the ip:port string of

/**
 * \defgroup lowlevelsend Low-Level Message Send
 *
 * Rather than passing all parameters in one call or letting O2
 * extract parameters from a message before calling its handler,
 * these functions allow building messages one parameter at a time
 * and extracting message parameters one at a time.
 * The functions operate on "hidden" messages, so these functions are
 * not reentrant.
 *
 * To build a message, begin by calling #o2_send_start to allocate a
 * message. Then call one of the `o2_add_*()` functions to add each
 * parameter. Finally, call either #o2_send_finish to send the 
 * message. You should not explicitly allocate or deallocate a 
 * message using this procedure.
 *
 * To extract parameters from a message, begin by calling
 * #o2_extract_start to prepare to get parameters from the
 * message. Then call #o2_get_next to get each parameter. If the
 * result is non-null, a parameter of the requested type was obtained
 * and you can read the parameter from the result. Results other than
 * strings, MIDI, and blobs may only remain valid until the next call
 * to #o2_get_next, so you should use or copy the value before reading
 * the next one. Values that are not coerced (requiring a copy) are 
 * left in the O2 message and have the same lifetime as the message.
 * You should not reuse this storage because the message may have
 * multiple destinations; thus, the message content should not be altered.
 *
 * A by-product of #o2_extract_start and #o2_get_next is an argument
 * vector (argv) that can be accessed from o2_argv. (This is the same
 * argument vector created automatically when a handler is added with
 * #o2_method_new when the parse parameter is true.) A possible
 * advantage of using a sequence of #o2_get_next calls rather than
 * simply setting the parse flag is that you can receive messages with
 * various types and numbers of parameters. Also, you can check vector
 * lengths and stop parsing if unacceptable lengths are encountered.
 * 
 * #o2_get_next will perform type conversion if possible
 * when the requested type does not match the actual type. You can
 * determine the original type by reading the type string in the
 * message. The number of parameters is determined by the length of
 * the type string, with some exceptions.
 *
 * Vectors can be coerced into arrays, in which case
 * each element will be coerced as requested. Arrays can be coerced 
 * into vectors if each element of the array can be coerced into
 * the expected vector element type. Vector lengths are provided by
 * the message; there is no way to coerce or limit vector lengths or
 * check that the length matches an expected value. (You can determine
 * the length from the return value and of course you can decide to
 * reject the message if the length is not acceptable.)
 *
 * When a vector is returned, the argument vector has a single element
 * that points to a vector descriptor (the "v" field), which contains
 * the vector element types and the length of the vector (>= 0).
 *
 * When an array is returned, the argument vector contains the value
 * o2_got_start_array followed by an o2_arg_ptr for each element of 
 * the array, followed by o2_got_end_array.
 *
 * When types T (True), F (False), I (Infinitum), or N (Nil) are in 
 * the message, there is an entry in the argument vector; however, 
 * there is no data associated with these types (other than the type
 * itself), so the pointers should not be used except to test for non-NULL.
 *
 * In all other cases, the argument vector contains data
 * corresponding to the data item in the message. This may be a pointer
 * into the actual message or a pointer to a temporary location in case
 * the element was coerced to a different type.
 *
 * When the actual type code in the message is in "TFIN" you should
 * call #o2_get_next even though there is no corresponding data
 * stored in the message. The return value, if successful, is a
 * non-NULL pointer that points within or just after the message, but
 * you must not dereference this pointer. (NULL indicates failure as
 * with other type codes. One rationale for calling #o2_get_next
 * even when there is nothing to "get" is that you can call
 * o2_get_next(O2_BOOL) to retrieve 'T', 'F', or 'B' types as an int32_t
 * which is 0 or 1. The 'I' and 'N' types are never coerced.
 *
 * Normally, you should not free the message because
 * normally you are accessing the message in a handler and the message
 * will be freed by the O2 message dispatch code that called the
 * handler.
 *
 * Arrays denoted by [...] in the type string are handled in a somewhat
 * special way:
 *
 * If an array is expected, call o2_get_next(O2_ARRAY_START). 
 * The return value will be
 * o2_got_start_array on success, or NULL if there is no array. The actual
 * value in the message may be an array or a vector. If it is a vector, the
 * elements of the vector will be coerced to the types requested in 
 * successive calls to #o2_get_next. After retrieving array elements, call
 * o2_get_next(O2_ARRAY_END). The return value should be o2_got_end_array.
 * NULL is
 * returned if there is an error. For example, suppose you call #o2_get_next
 * with characters from the type string "[id]" and the actual parameter is
 * a vector integers ("vi") of length 2. The return values from #o2_get_next
 * will be o2_got_start_array, an o2_arg_ptr to an integer, an o2_arg_ptr to
 * a double (coerced from the integer vector), and finally o2_got_end_array.
 * If the vector length is 1, the third return value will be NULL. If the
 * vector length is 3 (or more), the fourth return value will be NULL rather
 * than o2_got_end_array.
 *
 * The special values o2_got_start_array and o2_got_end_array are not valid
 * structures. In other words, fields such as o2_got_start_array->i32 are 
 * never valid or meaningful. Instead, o2_got_start_array and o2_got_end_array
 * are just 'tokens' used to indicate success in type checking. These values
 * are distinct from NULL, which indicates a type incompatibility.
 *
 * Note also that vector elements cannot be retrieved directly without
 * calling o2_get_next(O2_VECTOR) or o2_get_next(O2_ARRAY_START). 
 * For example, if the actual
 * argument is a two-element integer vector ("vi"), a call to 
 * o2_get_next(O2_INT32) will fail unless it is preceded by 
 * o2_get_next(O2_VECTOR) or o2_get_next(O2_ARRAY_START).
 *
 * If a vector is expected, call o2_get_next(O2_VECTOR). The return value will
 * be a non-null o2_arg_ptr if the next argument in the actual message 
 * is a vector or array, and otherwise NULL. You should not dereference this
 * return value yet...
 *
 * You *must* then call #o2_get_next with the desired type for vector 
 * elements. The return value will be an o2_arg_ptr (which will be
 * the same value previously returned) containing v.typ set to 
 * the desired type, v.len still set to the number of elements, and v.vi,
 * v.vh, v.vd, v.vf, or v.vc pointing to the possibly coerced elements.
 *
 * Note that the sequence of calling #o2_get_next twice for vectors
 * corresponds to the two type characters used to encode them, e.g. "vi"
 * indicates a vector of integers.
 *
 * Coercion is supported as follows. If coercion is provided from
 * the type indicated on the left on some row to the types corresponding
 * to columns where an "x" appears ("*" indicates special consideration

### Example 1: Simple but not completely robust

Note: call #o2_method_new with type_spec = "id", h = my_handler,
coerce = false, parse = false. In this case, since there is
no type coercion, type_spec must match the message exactly,
so #o2_get_next should always return a non-null o2_arg_ptr.
However, this code can fail if a badly formed message is sent
because there is no test for the NULL value that will be
returned by #o2_get_next.
\code{.c}
    int my_handler(o2_message_ptr msg, char *types,
                   o2_arg_ptr *argv, int argc, void *user_data)
    {
        o2_extract_start(msg);
        // we expect an int32 and a double argument

        double my_double = o2_get_next(O2_DOUBLE)->d;
        ...
    }
\endcode

### Example 2: Type coercion and type checking.

Note: call #o2_method_new with type_spec = NULL, h = my_handler,
coerce = false, parse = false. In this case, even though
coerce is false, there is no type_spec, so the handler will
be called without type checking. We could check the
actual message types (given by types), but here, we will
coerce into our desired types (int32 and double) if possible.
Since type coercion can fail (e.g. string will not be converted
to number, not even "123"), we need to check the return value
from #o2_get_next, where NULL indicates incompatible types.
\code{.c}
    int my_handler(o2_message_ptr msg, char *types,

 * /brief Schedule a message.
 *
 * Rather than sending a message, messages can be directly
 * scheduled. This is particulary useful if you want to schedule
 * activity before clock synchronization is achieved. For example, you
 * might want to poll every second waiting for clock
 * synchronization. In that case, you need to use the local scheduler
 * (#o2_ltsched). #o2_send will use the global time scheduler
 * (#o2_gtsched), so your only option is to construct a message and
 * call #o2_schedule_msg.
 *
 * @param scheduler a pointer to a scheduler (`&o2_ltsched` or
 *        `&o2_gtsched`)
 * @param msg a pointer to the message to schedule
 *
 * The message is scheduled for delivery according to its timestamp
 * (which is interpreted as local or global time depending on the
 * scheduler).
 *
 * The message is delivered immediately if the time is zero or less
 * than the current time; however, to avoid unbounded recursion,
 * messages scheduled within handlers are appended to a "pending
 * messages" queue and delivered after the handler returns.

/**
 * /brief Add a new transport to O2 process
 *
 * A bridge is an extension to O2 to allow communication with devices
 * over non-TCP/IP O2 protocols. For example, you can bridge to
 * Bluetooth, WebSockets, shared-memory threads or even microcontrollers
 * with TCP/IP where a simpler point-to-point connection is desired.
 * A bridge is a *run-time* extension to O2. Code external to O2 installs
 * and configures the bridge. Therefore, O2 does not need to be recompiled
 * to support a new protocol over a bridge -- extensions are all 
 * compiled separately. 
 *
 * @param protocol a unique name for this bridge, typically reflecting the
 *                 transport that it services, e.g. "O2lite" or "WebSock".
 *                 Note the 7-character limit.
 * @param bridge_poll will be called each time #o2_poll is called. This
 *                    function should check for incoming messages and/or
 *                    tend to outgoing messages.
 * @param bridge_send is called when an O2 message is sent to a service
 *                    offered by the bridge.
 * @param bridge_finish is called when O2 is shut down or to explicitly
 *                      close the brige.
 *
 * Details on bridge_send implementation: Call #o2_current_message to
 * obtain the message to be delivered. After processing the message, call
 * #o2_complete_delivery to free the message. The bridge can also assume 
 * ownership of the message beyond the scope of #bridge_send: Instead of 
 * calling #o2_complete_deliver (which frees the message), call 
 * #o2_postpone_delivery. Once #o2_postpone_delivery is called, you "own"
 * the message and are responsible for freeing it. To avoid memory leaks 
 * or potential reports of memory leaks, the bridge should be prepared to
 * free the message with #O2_FREE if #bridge_finish before the bridge 
 * frees the message. Typically, the message is held until the transport
 * can deliver all of its data; then use #O2_FREE to free the message.
 *
 * Note that there is no special way to inject messages into O2 from a
 * bridge. The #bridge_poll function will normally accept data from the
 * transport, marshall the data into an O2 message, and invoke O2 functions
 * to send the message.
 *
 * The #bridge_finish callback should free any allocated memory associated
 * with the bridge, but it should assume all instances (services) using the
 * bridge are removed already. These are automatically freed by 
 * #o2_bridge_remove or #o2_service_remove For this reason, never call 
 * the #bridge_finish or #o2_bridge_inst_finish functions directly.
 *
 * By default, the bridge is constructed with tag BRIDGE_NOCLOCK, which
 * means any message with a future timestamp will be scheduled locally
 * and sent at the time indicated by the timestamp. If and when the bridge
 * can handler timed deliveries (ideally, accurately scheduling at the
 * receiving end), set the tag to BRIDGE_SYNCED.
 *
 * To forward messages from O2, the bridge must create a local O2 service. Use
 * #o2_service_provider_new with the bridge as the "service" parameter
 * and the local process, `o2_ctx->proc` as the "proc" parameter.  The
 * properties parameter can be any property string, but typically is NULL.
 * Note that the service name is an #o2string, which means it is zero 
 * padded to a 32-bit boundary to support rapid hash function computation.
 * This is not a normal C string, which has no padding.
 * 
 * Bridges may install handlers for "/_o2/protocol/dy". The handler should
 * ensure that the first parameter matches #o2_ensemble_name and the rest 
 * of the parameters are protocol specific. E.g. "/_o2/o2lite/dy" is used
 * by O2lite processes to connect to O2 when o2lite is initialized.
 * 
 * Note that a bridge is a connection to a *transport* as opposed to a 
 * *process* or *host* computer. A single bridge may interface with multiple
 * connections to multiple endpoints. If this is the case, #bridge_send may
 * need a table to map service names to connections in order to properly
 * deliver messages. The O2 library implements hash tables and other functions
 * that may be useful, but these are not part of the public O2 API. In the
 * case of multiple connections, consider sending a unique identifier or number
 * to each connection, allowing service providers a way to create unique
 * service names.
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can install a new bridge for each connection, but
 * that means each bridge will be polled individually and the separate
 * bridges may have to coordinate to share a device. Also, each bridge will
 * need a unique protocol string to serve as an identifier.
