/** The O2lite protocol is a subset of O2. O2lite clients always
 * connect to a host called the "sponsor" running a full O2
 * implementation, never another O2lite client.  Due to the
 * peer-to-peer nature of O2, once connected, the O2lite host can send
 * messages to O2 services and also provide a service to the O2
 * ensemble. An O2lite host's services appear as services of the
 * sponsor, and therefore an O2lite service name cannot conflict with
 * a sponsor's service or the service of another O2lite host connected
 * to the same sponsor. Attempts to create conflicting services will
 * fail.
 *
 * O2lite offers a subset of functions available in O2.  The
 * functionality on the sponsor side limits what O2lite can do. There
 * are further limitations of this o2lite implementation, but this
 * does not mean extensions are not allowed. For portability and
 * interoperation, one should not assume greater functionality than
 * offered in this implementation. (These implementation restrictions
 * particularly include a restricted set of types in messages, no
 * pattern matching, and no support for bundles.)
 *
 * The O2lite protocol and O2 implementation of it support these
 * features:
 *    - create service (advertised on the sponsor side, messages are 
 *        forwarded to the O2lite side)
 *    - clock synchronization
 *    - send messages of any kind, including bundles, with any data types
 *    - every O2lite host is given a "bridge ID." The O2lite host can
 *        also obtain the O2 sponsor's full name. By combining them, the
 *        O2lite host can create a globally unique name of the form
 *        "@4a6dfb76:c0a801a6:fc1d:2", which has the public IP, local IP,
 *        port number of the sponsor, and bridge ID of the O2lite host.
 * This O2lite implementation has these restrictions:
 *    - no pattern matching for incoming messages
 *    - no bundle construction or handling
 *    - no type coercion -- message handlers can specify a type string 
 *        that must match exactly or the message will be dropped, or 
 *        message handlers can specify no types, in which case no types
 *        are checked and all messages are dispatched to the handler.
 *    - properties are not supported.
 *    - O2lite host has two status bits: connected and synchronized. There
 *        is no per-service status information, although a work-around is
 *        to poll services for status information.
 *    - message types are:
 *        - string
 *        - time
 *        - double
 *        - float
 *        - int32
 *    - message handlers are expected to call `o2l_get_float()`,
 *        `o2l_get_int()`, etc. in order to extract data from messages.
 *        O2lite does not construct an argument vector.
 *    - O2lite does not have a general scheduler. It only provides
 *        o2_local_time and o2l_get_time() (global time after clock sync).

// Discovery options:
//     o2discovery -- o2's original built-in protocol (default is false)
//         broadcast -- use broadcast to speed things up (default is true)
//     zeroconf -- use ZeroConf for discovery (default is true)
//     clocksync -- o2lite should synchronize with host (can be used with
//         either o2discovery or zeroconf) (default is true)
// Note that macros are "true" if defined, "false" if undefined, and most
//     are inverted, e.g. O2_NO_O2DISCOVERY rather than
//     O2_O2DISCOVERY, because most options are for disabling features;
//     thus, most macros are undefined.
// Here are the macros with their default values:
//     O2_NO_O2DISCOVERY -- O2 is not using built-in discovery; (defined)
//     O2_NO_ZEROCONF -- O2 is not using ZeroConf for discovery; (undefined)
//     O2L_NO_BROADCAST -- O2lite does not broadcast to speed up discovery
//         (undefined). This has no effect if O2_NO_O2DISCOVERY, which is
//         defined by default. The ZeroConf protocol ALWAYS uses broadcast
//         (even if O2L_NO_BROADCAST); it's internal to ZeroConf.

 * immediately, and o2lite will call the handler immediately, so it is
 * up to the application to deal with the timestamp.
