 * @param typespec the expected O2 type string (without ','), or NULL
 *                 to allow any types
 * @param full require a full exact match to the incoming address
 * @param h the handler to call for this message
 * @param info an optional value to pass to the handler. This can be
 *             useful if one handler handles multiple addresses
 * 
 * If full is false, this handler will match any address that begins with
 * #path provided that the next character in the address is '/' or
 * end-of-string. In other words, /s1/a does not act like /s1/a*, but it
 * can match /s1/a, /s1/a/b, /s1/a/c, etc.
 *
 * The handler will not be called if the #typespec does not match the
 * message type string exactly, except that a NULL #typespec will match
 * any types. Note that NULL and empty string ("") are not the same.
 *
 * Handlers are searched from newest to oldest, and they may not be removed.
 * (Although it would not be hard to add this functionality.)
 *
 * Handlers are not reentrant, so handle the message and copy out any data
 * you want to retain. The message is destroyed after the handler 
 * returns. 
 * 
 * Message handling is synchronous and driven by calls to #o2l_poll. 
 *
 * If a message is sent from O2 with a timestamp, but the o2lite process
 * does not have clock synchronization, the O2 process will use its 
 * scheduler to hold the message until the timestamp, delivering it
 * according to the timestamp but delayed by network latency. If the
 * o2lite process has synchronized clocks, the message will be sent
 * immediately, and o2lite will call the handler immediately, so it is
 * up to the application to deal with the timestamp.
