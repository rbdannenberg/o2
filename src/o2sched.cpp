/* O2sched.c -- scheduling
 */

/* Overview:
 
 There are two schedulers here: o2_gtsched, and o2_ltsched. They are identical,
 but one should use "real" local time, and the other should use
 synchronized clock time. There is no code here for smoothing the
 synchronized clock or making sure it does not go backward. (Well, maybe
 if it goes backward, nothing happens.)
 
 The algorithm is the "timing wheel" algorithm: times are quantized to
 "bins" of 10ms. These are "hashed" into a table using modulo arithmetic,
 so each time you poll for work, you linearly search bins for activity.
 Assuming you poll every 10ms or less, on average, you will only look
 into one bin. Each bin has a simple linked list of messages with
 timestamps. The lists are sorted in increasing time order. This means
 the insertion cost is O(N), but assuming messages are distributed evenly
 into the bins, the cost is reduced by a factor of SCHED_TABLE_LEN == 128.
 My guess is that few messages are actually scheduled, so in practice
 there should not be many collisions, e.g. the typical list length is
 0 or 1, making this a constant-time insert algorithm. The dispatch
 time is O(1) because lists are sorted with earliest time first. You
 also have to look at 100 bins per second whether anything is scheduled
 or not, but if you call poll every 10ms or so, scanning bins is not an
 issue. If time jumps by d, there is O(d) cost to scan the bins. However,
 the time constant is small: scanning even 10s worth of bins only requires
 looking at 1000 bins.
 
 Two difficult issues are: (1) the floating point time can be in the
 middle of a bin, so we need to be careful not to dispatch messages
 in the future, and since there may be messages in the bin that were
 not dispatched on the previous poll, we have to begin each poll by
 reexamining the bin where we stopped in the previous poll.
 
 (2) if time jumps ahead by more than SCHED_TABLE_LEN, we'll "wrap around"
 when we scan for messages and might schedule something out of order. To
 avoid this, we detect jumps and dispatch in 1s increments (the table size
 is 1.28s) to schedule messages in time order. (See more comments on this
 below.)
 
 This code assumes message structures have a "next" field so that we can
 make a linked list of messages, and also a "time" field with the scheduled
 time.
