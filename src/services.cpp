/*
Creating and deleting services. 
-------------------------------
Services are complicated because of the highly-linked structure
that connects to proc_info structures and osc_info structures
which have back pointers to services and sometimes share service
name strings that also appear as keys in services_entry nodes.

Services entry is created when:
- o2_tap_new creates services for tappee
    - calls o2_must_get_services()
- discovery finds services offered by remote proc, calls
    - o2_service_provider_new(), calls
        - o2_must_get_services()
- o2_service_new creates a service, calls
    - Services_entry::service_new(), calls
        - o2_service_provider_new()
- o2_osc_delegate creates a service to forward messages over OSC, calls
    - o2_service_provider_new()
- o2_mqtt_disc_handler() adds an MQTT process
- note: no service for local PORT:IP - send to _o2 instead

Services entry is destroyed when:
- remove_empty_services_entry() is called from
  - o2_service_remove() which is called from one of:
    - o2_services_handler() (discovery message with service or tap deletion)
    - o2_service_free()
    - o2_remove_services_by() called when process ends
*/


// internal implementation of o2_service_new, assumes valid
// service name with zero padding. The assumption is there will
// be methods with paths on this service, so the service is
// created as a Hash_node.
O2err Services_entry::service_new(O2string padded_name)
{
    // find services_node if any
    Hash_node *node = new Hash_node(NULL);
    // this will send /_o2/si message to local process:
    O2err rslt = service_provider_new(padded_name, NULL,
                                      node, o2_ctx->proc);
    if (rslt != O2_SUCCESS) {
        node->o2_delete();
        return rslt;
    }
    // Note that when the local @public:internal:port service is created,
    // there are no remote connections yet, so o2_notify_others()
    // will not send any messages.

/* add or update a service provider - a service is added to the list of 
 * services in  a service_entry struct.
 * 1) create the service_entry struct if none exists
 * 2) put the service onto process's list of service names
 * 3) add new service to the list
 *
 * service_name: service to add or update
 * properties: property string for the service
 * service: the service provider (e.g. remote process) or the 
 *          hash table or handler
 * proc: the process offering the service (remember that a service can
 *       be offered by many processes. The lowest IP:Port gets priority)
 *
 * CASE 1: this is a new local service
 *
 * CASE 2: this is the installation of /@public:internal:port for a newly
 *         discovered remote process. service == proc
 *
 * CASE 3: this is creating a service that delegates to OSC. service is
 *         an osc_info_ptr, process is the local process
 *
 * CASE 4: handling /@public:internal:port/sv: service is a Fds_info *equal
 *          to process. Note that /sv can indicate update to properties
 * 
 * CASE 5: this is the installation of /@public:internal:port for a newly
 *         discovered MQTT process. service == proc
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  - create or lookup service_name
 *  - find the service_provider entry in services for proc
 *  - if we already know about proc, this is a property update: do it
 *  - otherwise, add the proc by creating a new service_provider entry
 *  - if the proc is the active service provider, send an /_o2/si message.
