/*
Supports multiple connections to shared memory processes.
All shared memory processes use the same heap, and O2_MALLOC
is lock-free and thread-safe.

Therefore, O2message types can be transferred directly to
shared memory queues without byte-swapping, copying, or 
changing format.

The implementation is based on o2lite. Instead of O2lite_info
containing a Fds_info pointer (for the TCP connection) and the
udp_address, the O2sm_info contains an outgoing message queue.

Services provided by a shared memory process appear locally in the
services array entry as an O2sm_info, where messages can be directly
enqueued, making delivery quite fast and simple.

Received messages are all enqueued on a global o2sm_incoming queue,
which is checked by o2sm_poll. If messages are found, the entire queue
is atomically copied to a delivery queue, reversed, and then messages
are delivered to O2 in the correct order. Thus, O2sm_info do not
receive or deliver incoming messages to O2 -- it's handled by the
O2sm_protocol object.

Clock local time can be used from shared memory processes except
during a narrow window during o2_clock_set(), but this should 
only be called when the main process is initializing and selecting
a clock source (if any), and only if a non-default clock is set.
If a non-default callback is provided, it must be reentrant for
shared memory processes.

o2_time_get() is more of a problem: If a shared memory process calls
o2_time_get() while clock synchronization is updating local_time_base
global_time_base, and clock_rate, an inconsistent time could be
computed. I'm not very positive on memory barriers because of
portability, cost, and the difficulty to get them right. Another
solution is we can store the offset from local to global time in a
single atomic long or long long, and check for ATOMIC_LONG_LOCK_FREE
or ATOMIC_LLONG_LOCK_FREE to make sure simple reads and writes are
atomic. This will not compute exactly the right clock value when
clock_rate is not 1, but since it is close to 1 and if the offset
is updated at o2_poll() rate, the error will be tiny. In fact, we
could dispense with computing time completely and just use 
global values o2_local_now and o2_global_now, but since o2_poll() 
may not be called as frequently as needed, it's better to recompute
as needed in each shared memory process.

Timing in shared memory process is simpler and more limited than in
O2. Incoming messages with timestamps must arrive in time order.  A
timestamp out of order will be considered to be at the time just after
the previous timestamped message. Messages without timestamps,
however, are considered to be in a separate stream and their
processing is not delayed by timestamped messages.

The algorithm for message processing is:
First, move the entire incoming list atomically to a local list.
Run through the list, reversing the pointers (because the list is 
LIFO). Then traverse the list in the new order (the actual message
arrival order), appending each message to either the timestamped
queue or the immediate queue. These lists can have head and tail
pointers to become efficient FIFO queues because there is no
concurrent access.

Next, deliver all messages in the timestamped queue that are ready.
These get priority because, presumably, the timestamps are there
to optimize timing accuracy. Next deliver all non-timestamped
messages. An option, if message delivery is expected to be time
consuming, is to check the timestamped queue after each immediate
message in case enough time has elapsed for the next timestamped
message to become ready.

After deliverying all immediate messages, return from o2sm_poll().

MEMORY, INITIALIZATION, FINALIZATION

We will call the main O2 thread just that. The shared memory process
will be called the O2SM thread in this section. The steps below are
marked with either "(O2 thread)" or "(O2SM thread)" to indicate which
thread should run the operation.

Ownership: Every shared memory process has an O2_context and an
O2sm_info. The O2sm_info is owned by the O2 thread because the
O2 thread manages all bridges and when bridges or protocols shut
down, the O2 thread deletes bridge protocols and bridge instances.
The O2_context is owned by the O2SM thread and is often in static
memory. The O2_context has a pointer to the O2sm_info instance
where messages are queued from O2 to O2SM.

Shutting down the O2SM thread should be initiated by the O2SM thread
by calling o2sm_finish(), which finishes the O2SM context and sends
an /_o2/o2sm/fin message to O2. The application should shut down
O2SM threads before calling o2_finish(). Otherwise, there will be
contexts owned by O2SM threads with references to O2sm_info
instances. If the O2 thread deletes them, it leaves dangling
pointers that could crash O2SM threads. If O2 thread leaves them,
then memory is leaked and the O2SM thread will crash anyway because
o2_finish will free the O2 heap.

There is a synchronization issue: When the O2 thread wants to finish
or exit, how does it know when all O2SM threads have finished? The
application is responsible for shutting down O2SM threads *before*
calling o2_finish. Normally, this should be done by sending messages.
There is no standard message or built-in mechanism for this, since
creating and exiting threads is not an O2 operation. After all
O2SM threads call o2sm_finish() and their fin messages are handled,
there will be no more O2sm_info instances, so the O2 thread should
wait for that. While waiting, the O2 thread must call o2_poll() to
receive and handle fin messages. To check for instances, use
o2_shmem_inst_count().

o2_shmem_initialize() - Initially, an array of O2sm_info* is
    created, a new bridge protocol for "o2sm" is created, and a
    handler is created for /_o2/o2sm/sv and /_o2/o2sm/fin. (O2 thread)

o2_shmem_inst_new() - creates a new O2sm_info. The O2sm_info must be
    passed to the O2SM thread. It is also stored in the o2sm_bridges
    array. (O2 thread)
 
o2_shmem_inst_count() - returns the number of shared memory instances.

o2sm_initialize() - installs an O2_context for the O2SM thread and
    retains the Bridge_info* which contains a message queue for
    messages from O2SM to O2*. The O2_context contains mappings from
    addresses to handlers in path_tree and full_path_table.  (O2SM
    thread)

o2sm_get_id() - returns a unique ID for this bridged process. This
    might be useful if you want to create a unique service that does
    not conflict with any host services or services by other shared
    memory or other bridged processes using other protocols,
    e.g. o2lite. Note that *all* bridged processes and their host
    share must have non-conflicting service names. While other full O2
    processes can offer duplicated service names (and messages are
    directed to the service provider with the highest pip:iip:port
    name), duplicates are not allowed between hosts and their bridged
    processes.  (O2SM thread)

o2sm_service_new() - creates handlers on the O2 side via /_o2/o2sm/sv
    messages. (O2SM thread)

o2sm_method_new() - inserts handlers into the O2_context mappings.
    (O2SM thread)

o2sm_finish() - To shut down cleanly, first the O2SM thread should
    stop calling o2sm_poll() and call o2sm_finish(), which frees the
    O2SM O2_context structures (but not the O2sm_info), and calls
    /_o2/o2sm/fin with the id as parameter. (O2SM thread)

o2_shmem_finish() - shuts down the entire "o2sm" protocol. First, 
    o2sm_bridges is searched and any instance there is deleted by
    calling o2_shmem_inst_finish(). Then o2sm_bridges is freed.

Typical shared memory process organization is as follows:

#include "o2internal.h"  // O2_context is not defined in o2.h, so use this
#include "sharedmem.h"
Bridge_info *smbridge = NULL; // global variable accessed by both threads

int main()
{
    ...
    // create the shared memory process bridge (execute this in O2 thread):
    int err = o2_shmem_initialize(); assert(err == O2_SUCCESS);
    smbridge = o2_shmem_inst_new();
    // create shared memory thread
    err = pthread_create(&pt_thread_pid, NULL, &shared_memory_thread, NULL);
    ... run concurrently with the shared memory thread ...
    ... after shared memory thread shuts down, consider calling o2_poll()
    ... in case any "last dying words" were posted as incoming messages
    o2_finish(); // closes the bridge and frees all memory, including
                 // chunks allocated by shared_memory_thread
}

#include "sharedmemclient.h"

void *shared_memory_thread(void *ignore) // the thread entry point
{
    O2_context ctx;
    o2sm_initialize(&ctx, smbridge); // connects us to bridge
    ... run the thread ...
    o2sm_finish();
    return NULL;
