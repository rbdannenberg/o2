Bugs:
    massive printout for HTTP
    if websocket client tries to initialize with wrong ensemble name, 
        server closes connection and crashes
    does clock sync work over http? When I wait for O2_LOCAL status,
        I never get it, even though I see clock sync messages. Maybe
	it works now after calling o2_set_clock().
    After ^C running ~/soundcool/imuo2/soundcool_imu.bug.srp, there's
        a segfault.
    verbose output when running a websocket o2lite connection
    ESP32 does not reconnect when o2 host reboots
    HTTP is really slow for big files. Order of 100KB/s for localhost
        (no network). Maybe blocks are too small.
    compare o2sm_dispatch to o2_msg_deliver -- it looks like at least
            there's a bug in o2sm_dispatch with conditional
            compilation around message to the service itself.
        
    

Tests we need:
    see if multiple O2lite clients can connect
    see if O2lite clients can discover host with their own discovery
        messages
    see if O2lite clients can use host discovery messages
    see if multiple O2sm client threads work
    test TTL feature and tap loops
