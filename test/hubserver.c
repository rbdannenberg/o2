// hubserver.c - test hub discovery
//
// use with hubclient.c
//
// start_timer() is set after first discovery, so times will pretty closely
// match throughout execution even when client and server stop and restart
// o2. This was done to debug the complex interaction sequence.
//
// Use ordinary discovery for client to discover this server at time t-0.5.
// at t, client shuts down and delays 1.5s
// t+0.5s, server shuts down and restarts
// t+1.0s, client starts after server. Server sends IP:port to client.
// t+1.5s, client shuts down and server calls o2_hub(NULL) to stop discovery.
// t+2.0s, server checks that client is gone.
// t+2.5s, client reinitializes and uses o2_hub() to connect to server.
//             (hub is server which was first to start)
// Server looks for message from client.
// Server replies to client. Now we want to try making the hub the 2nd
//             process to start. That would be the client, but the client
//             has already used o2_hub() to contact the server, so start over:
// t+3.0s, server shuts down, client shuts down.
// t+3.5s, server restarts
// t+4.0s, client restarts after server. Client sends IP:port to server.
// t+4.5s, server shuts down and client calls o2_hub(NULL) to stop discovery.
// t+5.0s, client checks that server is gone.
// t+5.5s, server reinitializes and uses o2_hub() to connect to client.
//             (hub is client which was second to start)
// Client looks for message from server. Sends reply.
// t+6.0s, both client and server shut down.
