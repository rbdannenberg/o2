<h1>O2 IP String Test</h1>
This is just enough padding to split the IP string pattern
across two input messages. The pattern must be detected even
when falling across two messages, and the pattern must be
replaced properly across the two messages.

<p>Testing shows that with this line, the following pattern is split
across two messages.</p>
<h2>"ws://THE.LOC.ALH.OST:PORTNO/o2lite"</h2>
The previous paragraph should show the actual IP address and port
number of the server in large bold letters. If it contains
THE.LOC.ALH.OST, then something is wrong.
